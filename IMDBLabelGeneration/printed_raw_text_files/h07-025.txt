The figures for Corby and Peterlee (where the prime need so far has been to provide
employment for women and girls) are 82 per cent and 74 per cent respectively. Shop-
ping provision in the new towns has generally been based on an estimated need of
about eight shops for every thousand people, this being considered sufficient to allow
for shoppers coming into the town from surrounding areas.
