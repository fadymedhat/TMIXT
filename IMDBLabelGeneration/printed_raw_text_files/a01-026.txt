MR. IAIN MACLEOD, the Colonial Secretary, denied in the Commons last night that
there have been secret negotiations on Northern Rhodesia's future. The Northern
Rhodesia conference in London has been boycotted by the two main settlers' parties
- the United Federal Party and the Dominion Party. But representatives of Sir
RoyWelensky, Prime Minister of the Central African Federation, went to Chequers at the
week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan.
