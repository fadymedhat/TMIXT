Two emissaries from the Laotian Government of Prince Boun Oum have arrived in
Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to invite Prince Souvanna Phouma, the former Prime Min-
ister, to return to Laos. No details of their mission have been disclosed, but it was
reported earlier in Laos that Prince Boun Oum was considering asking Prince Sou-
vanna Phouma to join his Government.
