THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society. A policy of racial discrimination in
any of its countries is surely the one thing that it could not survive. Whatever
statesmen say at the conference table in London, millions at home would regard as
fraudulent a Commonwealth which had room for a racist South Africa. And this is a
Commonwealth in which five citizens are coloured for every one who is white.
