During this period, when large numbers of school-leavers will be looking for jobs,
there will be relatively few retirements. For the most part therefore local employment
can be provided only by the expansion of existing industry and the introduction of
new factories, laboratories and offices, and the expected but not easily stimulated
development of the service industries. Schemes for training young people in industry
and commerce will be particularly important in the new towns.
