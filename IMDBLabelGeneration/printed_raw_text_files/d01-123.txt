The verso of the roll was blank, and one cannot think of an author, Mark for example,
sending out his Gospel lacking the ending, while one whole side of his roll was unused.
The codex form was not so accommodating. Even in the case of the single-sheet quire,
an extra sheet glued on might have to be gummed on over the binding, or the whole
codex rebound.
