In the first place it is not a great deal of use telling even children, as I have already
suggested, not to be silly or to pull themselves together. Far better to help them to
face whatever it is that is worrying them, to find the original cause and then deal with
it; show it up either for the sham it is - and many fears are based upon completely
irrational pre-conceived notions - or to show how we may deal with it so as to remove
the power to torment us that it seems to possess.
