"Thinking over the results of the Vienna meeting, peace-loving people will say 'a good
beginning.'" Mr. Krushchov remained at the airport to join President Brezhnev in
welcoming Dr. Sukarno, President and Prime Minister of Indonesia, who arrived by
Boeing 707 jet on a state visit 40 minutes after Mr. Khrushchov had arrived from
Vienna. A cheering, delighted crowd of Indonesian students broke through crash
barriers to surround their President on the tarmac for several minutes, chanting his
name and waving flowers.
