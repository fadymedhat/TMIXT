I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the old, star-studded West End than
he will ever feel in Hollywood. His American bosses, 20th-Century Fox, have recently
given Frankie the full, razzamataz, red-carpet treatment. But they haven't done a
thing for his film career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not doing better
here, before the platinum-plated Hollywood carrot was dangled before his nose.
