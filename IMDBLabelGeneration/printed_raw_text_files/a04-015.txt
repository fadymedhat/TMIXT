The joint communique on Mr. Kennedy's and Mr. Macmillan's third talks - the
first were at Key West, Florida, the second in Washington - said: "Their discussions
covered the major problems, both economic and political, and revealed once again
the close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their common purposes.
"Occasion was given to review the need for economic co-operation and expansion in
the general interests of developed and underdeveloped countries alike."
