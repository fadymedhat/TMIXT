The more delicate patterns and finer threads may be reserved to bring a light and
lovely touch to personal possessions - a lace border to a handkerchief, fine-lace inser-
tion on a petticoat or blouse, a tatted edge to a collar; these add a charming, feminine
distinction that nothing else can give. Although we assess lace-making as one of the
feminine skills, a number of the well-loved traditional patterns that we follow today
were, in fact, the brain-children of inventive men.
