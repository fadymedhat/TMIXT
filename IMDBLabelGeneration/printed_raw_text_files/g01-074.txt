London was again in turmoil; but this time over a question of trade rivalry. A rich
merchant from Genoa had been murdered, and John de Kyrkby, a Londoner, was
one of those charged with the crime. It is clear from the chronicles that this was a
sordid quarrel between monopolists and interlopers. The city merchants were jealous
of foreign merchants who could tempt court and baronage with rarer luxuries than
those within the scope of English traders, and whose prices could not be controlled
in the interests of the city rings.
