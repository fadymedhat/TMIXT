It seems obvious that if an expedition to Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais,
then the primary essential to the success of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
command of the Channel. It seems obvious that divided forces were dissipating the
advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included Calais, Cherbourg, Brest, Bor-
deaux and Bayonne, and that there was no hope of final victory without a large-scale
and concentrated invasion.
