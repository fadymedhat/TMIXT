Though in the minds of most people there was no doubt that the woman had been the
victim of foul play, the verdict brought in was that there was not sufficient evidence
to show whether she had fallen or been thrown from a train. The Merstham Tunnel,
on the London-to-Brighton line, is approximately one mile long, and some time before
midnight on September 24, 1905, a Sunday, Sub-Inspector Peacock, of the London,
Brighton and South Coast Railway, who was in charge of a gang of men engaged in
relining the tunnel, was walking through when he stumbled over something in the
darkness.
