THE Marriage-Go-Round (Carlton) is also a comedy of manners, but fun-films toting
an X certificate have to keep a sharp look-out that the jokes about sex (what else
would they joke about with an X?) are of the witty, verbal variety and not the visual
slapstick. This has only one gag - that of the entry of a gladiator (female, 7ft. high,
'stacked' and Scandinavian) into the cosy but unbelievably elegant household of a pair
of married college professors.
