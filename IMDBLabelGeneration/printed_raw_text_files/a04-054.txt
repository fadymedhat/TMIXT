That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine. So long as the Soviet Union
had nuclear weapons, the West, somewhere, must have them too. It was far better
for a weapon used for retaliatory purposes to be under the sea rather than on land.
This was why the Labour Party did not think it right to oppose the Polaris depot
ship.
