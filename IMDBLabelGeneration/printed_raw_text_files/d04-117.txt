Leaning back carries the concealed message. And we start the Seder showing the
Matzos, that they represent the "Bread of Poverty" which our fore-fathers were eating
in Mitzrajim, to show they were willing to learn; and we invite anybody who wishes
to partake in our discussions, saying: "Anybody who is hungry, let him come and eat,
Anybody who is thirsty, let him come and drink."
