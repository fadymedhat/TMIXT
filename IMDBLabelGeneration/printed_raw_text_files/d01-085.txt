Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that the original of the Gospel
would be unmarked. The original of the Gospel, whether written on a roll or codex,
whether paragraphed or not, would be laid out in columns. This is the invariable
practice of ancient manuscripts. A common size of column would hold about one
third of a page of Souter's print.
