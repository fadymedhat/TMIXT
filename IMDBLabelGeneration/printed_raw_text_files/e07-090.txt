Present-day pots are better finished, do not get dirty so readily and are easier to wash.
The deep rims make for neater and safer stacking, though they are still expensive and
still get broken. On the other hand, there is really no replacement for the larger sizes,
so they have the decided advantage of being the only suitable container available in
quantity for fairly large plants.
