Note that squared lines marking the top member of the toe are needed as well as the
upper extent of the taper, and in this case it is necessary to mark in the line of the
taper with pencil and straight-edge as at (B), Fig. 3. A saw cut is made at the upper
toe line exactly down to the taper line, no farther.
