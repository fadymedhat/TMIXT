Though they may gather some Left-wing support, a large majority of Labour M Ps
are likely to turn down the Foot-Griffiths resolution. Mr. Foot's line will be that as
Labour M Ps opposed the Government Bill which brought life peers into existence,
they should not now put forward nominees. He believes that the House of Lords
should be abolished and that Labour should not take any steps which would appear
to "prop up" an out-dated institution.
