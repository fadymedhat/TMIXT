Anyhow, Homer does not seem to have known any way of cooking meat except by
roasting and boiling. When Achilles gave a royal feast the principal dish was a grill,
which he cooked himself, and he knew how to do it, too: - When the languid flames at
length subside, He throws a bed of glowing embers wide; Above the coals the smoking
fragment turns, And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns.
