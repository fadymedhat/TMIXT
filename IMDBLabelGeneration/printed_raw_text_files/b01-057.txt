A CURIOUS advertisement appears on page nine, paid for by that curious body
Moral Re-Armament. Those who lend their names to this kind of advertisement are
worthy people, a little innocent of politics, perhaps, or carried away by the idea that
moral regeneration would solve all our problems. So it would. While we are waiting
for the millenium, however, most of us would prefer to put our hopes for earthly
justice in instruments of democracy, such as trade unions and our local and national
Parliaments.
