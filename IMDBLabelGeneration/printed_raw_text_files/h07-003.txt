The average gross return on established industrial estates ranges from 7 to 9 per cent
of the capital expenditure on land, site works and buildings. Manufacturing industry
affords employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as manual workers. An
analysis made by Crawley Development Corporation in 1958, after collating replies
from fifty-eight manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff, showed that
5 per cent of the staff were classed as managerial and administrative, 11 per cent as
technical or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical.
