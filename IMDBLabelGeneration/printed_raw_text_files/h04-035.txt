Consumption by younger childless couples declined throughout this period, but that
of the smaller families was maintained except for the slight fall in 1959. In the largest
families, particularly those containing four or more children, there was a tendency for
consumption to increase between 1955 and 1957, and thereafter to decline. Graduated
scales of family allowances were introduced in October 1956, and the welfare milk
subsidy was reduced in April 1957.
