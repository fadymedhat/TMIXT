So the arrival of any particular shoal fish at a certain spawning ground may be ac-
cidental. Yet there will always be some that find it if enough are travelling, just as
the robin who gets back exactly may be only one among thousands who do not. But
this southerly migration is not accidental. Being contranatant or against the drift, it
probably has a survival value in ensuring that the fry after hatching are drifted back
into the normal home of the adults, by the water flow through the English Channel
into the North Sea.
