Peron entered, a large man, who had once been handsome but was now seedy-looking,
a sufferer from stomach-ulcers. In the Back-Face tradition he wore, and kept on
indoors, a fifty gallon hat. Harry was prepared for something unpleasant, for this was
the Senator who had annoyed the United States by bragging how he had once won a
trick from W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his rockets (an admission which
would scarcely help bluff to succeed the next time) and, lately, by saying that if Mo
land-troops had to come to the aid of the O.G.O. contingent in the Panama region,
"no Mo dough-boy will want to have an American G.I. fighting alongside him."
