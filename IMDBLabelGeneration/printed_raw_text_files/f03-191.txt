May I suggest that you have proved that right! Congratulations! And away you go
into your speech. Take some thought, too, for your ending. Thank you for listening
to me so patiently. A political candidate often used that finish. No wonder he didn't
get in! Instead he might have ended this way: Well, those are my views.
