Alongside these divisions a force of over 600 Starfighters provided by the Americans is
growing up. These "fighters" are in fact fighter bombers which could launch an
atomic attack on Eastern Europe. By 1963 the Germans plan to have nine missile
battalions, with 288 missiles and 36 firing ramps, including weapons like Matador
(range 950 miles), also provided by the Americans.
