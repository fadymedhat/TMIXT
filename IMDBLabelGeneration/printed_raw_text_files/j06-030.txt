It seems likely that a continuous interchange was taking place between the population
at the surface and that in deeper water. A second group whose normal vertical mi-
gration is sufficiently well known to make daytime occurrence at the surface rank as
anomalous is the Euphausiacea. There are numerous records of euphausiids swimming
at the surface in bright sunshine, with particular mention of their shoaling behavior
under these circumstances.
