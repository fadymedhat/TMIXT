It would become easy to become cynical and to despair. And yet, wherever the issues
were put clearly, sections of the movement reaffirmed their original stand. Only where
the issues were posed so as to cause doubt and confusion were positions lost. It is
my view that this immediate confusion hides the fact that the Peace movement is
still advancing and that clarification of the issues can bring a majority to secure the
Scarborough decisions.
