Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an egg-case of the Chinese mantis. The first
mantis had hatched from the very large egg-case on June 6. Both the Chinese and
Spanish mantis, in the young stage at any rate, are light brown in colour. Because of
the cool, wet weather, I had great difficulty in breeding fruit flies and, after many of
the mantis of both types had died in my Kilner jars, I poured living mantis over vines
and peachtrees.
