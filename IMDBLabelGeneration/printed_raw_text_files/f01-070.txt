Can we now put forward any reasonably clear picture of this "basis" of mental phe-
nomena? The physicists have succeeded remarkably well, with the atomic theory, in
giving a clear and detailed picture of the basis of such material phenomena as chem-
ical action, magnetism, the behaviour of gases and so on. Where has psychology got
to in its theories of "mind"? Are there any ultimate units of mind akin to the atoms
of matter?
