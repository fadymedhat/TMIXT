Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with considerable fidelity, the film tells
the story of a little monk who prays that a disreputable night club near his church
be removed. One night his prayer is answered and the offending establishment is
suddenly transplanted to an island in the North Sea. But Father Malachias's troubles
have only begun. Instead of having the desired effect, the miracle becomes exploited
by a group of shrewd newspapermen.
