SIR Roy Welensky said today that he no longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Ken-
neth Kaunda. Sir Roy, Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister, said that Mr. Kaunda's
United National Independence Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia National
Congress, which was led by Mr. Kaunda until he was outlawed in 1959. The record of
lawlessness among UNIP supporters went back a long way, Sir Roy told the Federal
Parliament in Salisbury.
