Provided the temperatures at C and E are the same, thermoelectric contributions to
the voltage should be zero. The probe extends out of the sodium stream through a
close fitting thin walled T-Junction F and passes into the open via a water-cooled O
ring seal G. The open end of the probe is sealed with a vacuum coupling H which also
positions the +ve nickel conductor with respect to the sodium by circlips on either
side of the seal I.
