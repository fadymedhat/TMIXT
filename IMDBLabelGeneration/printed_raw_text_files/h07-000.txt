Of over 7,000,000 square feet of factory space built by the development corporations,
about 20 per cent represents extensions built after the firms had become established.
It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-rents or ground rents for their
factories or industrial sites; and rents vary considerably according to the demand for
factory accommodation.
