In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom. Their descent stops
at the end of the light pressure. But they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side, or
westerly, until in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the echo-
sounders. Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach their optimum depth;
and this coincides with the suitable gravelly soil of these many roughs where the
spring-spawning herring are always found.
