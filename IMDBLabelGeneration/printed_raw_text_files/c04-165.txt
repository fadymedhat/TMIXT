The film replaced "What's My Line?" and "Be My Guest" programmes because of
an electricians' strike. It showed Britain today through the eyes of an American T
V reporter, Eric Sevareid, and British personalities. Among them - Professor Dennis
Brogan, Shelagh Delaney, and Alan Sillitoe. The film covered a wide aspect of the
British scene, ranging from pubs, the Eton wall game, to the European Common
Market.
