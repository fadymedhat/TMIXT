In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements from the dissection of
living animals, showing how these movements alternate with rests and are seen best

becomes generally constricted, its walls thicken, its ventricles decrease in volume and
it expels its content of blood, appearing paler in so doing in animals such as serpents,
frogs, and the like.
