In VIENNA, before flying off to Moscow, Mr. Khrushchov said he hoped his weekend
talks with President Kennedy would help "to establish an enduring peace between
nations." Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President Schaerf, the Soviet
Premier thanked Austria for the hospitality and welcome he had received. "The
Soviet Union has always striven and is striving to safeguard an enduring peace for the
peoples, to secure an early solution of the disarmament problem, and to bring about
a peaceful settlement of international disputes through negotiations," he said.
