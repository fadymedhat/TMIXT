journal said, "the deafening peal of thunder, the sudden immersion in gloom, and the
clash of reverberated sounds in a confined space combine to produce a momentary
shudder, or idea of destruction, a thrill of annihilation." It was also prophesied that
passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the darkness.
