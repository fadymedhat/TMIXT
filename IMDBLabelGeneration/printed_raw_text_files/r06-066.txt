Then here was Nice, and the old holiday sea, blue as a new school exercise book.
The same old Nice, creamy, vulgar, out of time, bitter-sweet with the ghosts of dead
monarchs and brilliant prostitutes, edging past grubby grandeur to the old sleeping
port. This, and Paris, were my ruined pavilions, and I could catch the taste of dead
dreams on my tongue like spray.
