RELAXED, smiling and clearly in the best of spirits, Mr. Krushchov yesterday
returned to Moscow after his two days of talks with President Kennedy, writes Dennis
Ogden from Moscow. The good beginning made at Vienna must be followed up by new
efforts for peace, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda declared yesterday.
Events in Vienna "gave hope to people of goodwill who hate the cold war, and to all
who are striving for a stable peace," write the paper's two correspondents from the
Austrian capital.
