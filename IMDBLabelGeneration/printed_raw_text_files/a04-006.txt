Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still wanted him to apply for membership
of the Common Market, even if it meant an unconditional surrender. There were also
brief discussions on Laos, Berlin and other foreign questions, after Mr. Kennedy had
informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr. Krushchov. With the exception
of 40 minutes when Lord Home, Foreign Secretary, and Mr. McGeorge Bundy, the
President's special assistant for security affairs, were brought in, the two men talked
alone.
