Having trimmed up the chines, we are now ready to plank the sides. Start again at
the bows, clamping into position with a 'D' clamp. Bend round the frame to the
stern and clamp there. If you have a third clamp use it in the centre as well. After
generously covering with glue, screw the sides to the transom framing and the chine.
