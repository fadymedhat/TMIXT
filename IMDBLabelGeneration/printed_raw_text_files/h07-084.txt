Londoners not in housing need, but whose departure from London may be assumed to
release accommodation there, are recruited for jobs which cannot be filled through the
industrial selection scheme, and only as a last resort are people from outside London
allotted new town houses. As a result, almost 80 per cent of the houses let by the
development corporations in the London new towns have gone to Londoners, about
half of whom are known to have been on local authority housing lists.
