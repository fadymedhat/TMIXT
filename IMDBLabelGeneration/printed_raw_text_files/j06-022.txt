The most clearly substantiated case is that of the copepod Anomalocera patersoni,
which remains permanently at the surface. Among other copepods Rhincalanus gigas,
Calanoides acutus, Microcalanus pygmaeus, Oithona frigida, and Centropages typicus
are all reported as showing no migration. The predaceous cladoceran Bythotrephes
longimanus also remains at one level, about 10 meters down.
