Criticisms about Army manpower appear to have come mainly from retired officers
who have held high positions but are out of touch with the existing situation. Mr.
Watkinson has had the utmost support from the C.I.G.S., Field-Marshal Sir Francis
Festing, who believes completely in the principle of an all-Regular army. Gen. Sir
Richard Hull, who is to succeed Sir Francis, is equally convinced Mr. Watkinson is
right.
