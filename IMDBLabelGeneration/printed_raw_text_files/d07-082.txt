(Actually, the Mishnah quotes two further proof texts and the Gemara explains why
these, too, are necessary, but a careful examination of that passage makes it clear that
these are not quoted here because they are not necessary to prove the point made by
R. Joshua b. Levi.) Finally, we note that the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
elsewhere.
