Dr. Davidson said he would go for a walk over the fields while we attended to our
business. To my amusement, when we met at tea at the rectory after the Dedication,
the Archbishop said he had been stopped by a farmer in a field. He seemed rather
indignant, but we took the episode without a smile till afterwards.
