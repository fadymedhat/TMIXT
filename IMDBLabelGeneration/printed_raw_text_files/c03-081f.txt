Arguably, the dramatist has committed a technical error in allowing Irene to speak
for herself; we would be altogether clearer in our minds about her if she remained
a flawed but beautiful enigma, seen but not heard. However, Miss Pinkie Johnstone
makes her few brief scenes effective, and Mr. Dinsdale Landen, in the longest and
most exacting role, that of the sergeant, gives a performance of rare intelligence and
restrained power.
