Distribution over the town as a whole varies, the smaller towns tending to rely mainly
on the town centres with a few "pantry" shops in the neighbourhoods and the larger
ones providing neighbourhood centres of up to thirty or more shops at the heart of
the residential areas, as well as small sub-centres in outlying districts.
