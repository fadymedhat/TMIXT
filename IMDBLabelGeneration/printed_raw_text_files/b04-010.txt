Who will speak up for Belgium? Who else but Britain. We have fought beside
Belgium in two world wars. We are allies still. Britain should champion Belgium.
Not with the careful, hooded language of diplomacy, but boldly and fearlessly. It is
time to show the world that this country does not desert her friends. HAPPY, happy
families! Never before have Britain's larders been so well stocked.
