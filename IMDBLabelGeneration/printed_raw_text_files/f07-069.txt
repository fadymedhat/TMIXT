Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament than is customarily imagined
as well as entering human activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed. We
naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes one of its most classic features
to the Turkish rule under which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years. If
that country had not been for so long a battlefield red with the blood shed to defend
Christian civilisation, Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which
provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant scarlet hue.
