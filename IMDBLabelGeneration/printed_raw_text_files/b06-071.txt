Ordinary working people will never rally to defend a policy founded on political
chicanery or elect a Labour Government to carry through Tory policy - Gaitskell's
stupid hope. The tragedy is that enormous inroads could already have been made
into Tory strength by a fighting policy, based on Scarborough. THE desire for unity
in the Labour and trade union movement following the discussions that have taken
place during the past two years on defence is something that should be recognised by
all concerned.
