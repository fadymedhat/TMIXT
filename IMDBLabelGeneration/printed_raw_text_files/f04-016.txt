Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon, and arrived at Hounslow
around 5 P.M., where she had tea with her other sister, and then went to catch
the 7.42. Her sister saw her to the station, helping her with some of her packages.
This sister was able to establish that she had carried a green purse and had bought a
railway ticket.
