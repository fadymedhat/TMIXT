Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple arithmetic which argued that, as the
first poll-tax had supplied 22,000, a tax of three times the rate would produce 66,000.
The only concession made in view of the objections to the first two poll-taxes was the
suggestion that the rich should help the poor - but this was only a pious hope because
no machinery was provided for carrying it into effect, and a subordinate clause went
far to nullify what small effects it had - no man and wife together were to pay more
than twenty shillings, a restriction which applied to the generous rich as well as to
the mean.
