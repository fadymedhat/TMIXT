The chine is the long stringer on each side which is joined to both transoms and lies
in the grooves cut in the moulds. Each chine is made of oak, ash, spruce or any long
grained flexible wood. I prefer spruce when available. As will be seen in the plan, the
transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in. on each side.
