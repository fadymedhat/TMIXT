This is not a filmed play. It has been conceived throughout in terms of the cinema, and
again and again it is the visual qualities of the story, and the marriage of the central
characters to their background, which bring the film so vividly to life. In Fanny, which
also has its premiere tomorrow, the director, Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed
to create the atmosphere of a city.
