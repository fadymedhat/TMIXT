This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure a permanently water proof glue line.
Be sure to see that the edge bears the mark, P.M.B.C. Exterior. This may be bought
at any good timber merchants. The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply wood
of the same make, or oak or mahogany. For the last one I made, I used the two flaps
from an old mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one shilling.
