In those early years 1914-18, life was very full both in the parish and in the wider war
activities. The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in Bavaria, asked me if I
would do something for two wards at the Royal Herbert Hospital, full of war prisoners.
I was very glad to help in this way, and visited them frequently, establishing at once a
friendly contact with the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find someone who
knew their native villages.
