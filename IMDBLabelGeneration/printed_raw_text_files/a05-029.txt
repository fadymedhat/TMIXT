Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard as from Nov. 1. The hand-over, due in
September, was delayed because of the Berlin crisis. Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
felt the change would be unwise at a moment when attention had to be concentrated
on possible need for important military operations. For this reason Sir Francis stayed
on, and sacrificed his leave.
