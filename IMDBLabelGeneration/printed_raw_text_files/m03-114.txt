But all three were to the casual observation I permitted myself unruffled; Mr Septimus
reserved and certainly very thoughtful, but that was his habit. Indeed we were all
invaded by a most tranquil mood. Even the Indian servants relaxed, knowing, so Mr
Gilberto told us, that the wild and savage tribes never approached this region: at
any rate they remained with us, perhaps for such protection as our presence, or Mrs
Caine's, afforded, sticking rather to their quarters, going no further than the beach
to fish, whereas we ourselves explored the whole neighbourhood, half, I think with an
eye to fabulous remains.
