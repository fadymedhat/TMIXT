The original scheme was planned to provide short refresher courses at the ages of
fifty-five and sixty: the first of these is due in 1963. Meanwhile, each 'graduate' is
encouraged to seek help and advice in working out his ideas, either through the com-
pany's personnel department or by an approach to members of the panel responsible
for the scheme.
