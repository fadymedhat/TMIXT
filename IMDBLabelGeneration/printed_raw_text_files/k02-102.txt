There was still an ease in our conversation, but its scope was restricted. I felt that I
could hardly make the usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses
as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him, much as I wondered which of his girls
was in favour at the moment. And I suppose he felt the same. We had only a few
drinks, then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early dinner.
