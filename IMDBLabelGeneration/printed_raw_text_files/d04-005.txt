According to the legend, Solomon had asked the Prince of the Demons, "Ashmodeus"
to bring him the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the Shamir had not been
placed under his charge, as there is no Shamir in Gehenna (Hell). An eagle brought
the Shamir to Solomon from Eden, the Paradise, the only place where the Shamir
could be found.
