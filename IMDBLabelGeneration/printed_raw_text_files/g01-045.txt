In addition to these revenues, the King had the financial benefits of his position at the
head of the feudal system, as its chief landowner and the recipient of the fines of royal
justice. It was, therefore, a complicated and not very satisfactory financial system in

between private and national war, and in which the comparatively simple obligations
of the feudal pyramid were becoming hopelessly involved with the complex bonds of
trade and industry.
