What happened to the new book partially tape-recorded by his publishers in March
of last year? Still a skeleton. Yet I have before me now a 12,000-word manuscript of
a book planned to be called Confessions of an Irish Rebel which was delivered to his
agents in June. IT begins: "There was a party to celebrate Deirdre's return from her
abortion in Bristol."
