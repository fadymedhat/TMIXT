Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian parties had refused to attend the talks
because Sir Roy had found messages sent from the Government were "unsatis-fac-
tory." African delegates to the talks yesterday called on Mr. Macmillan to cease his
negotiations with Sir Roy's representative, Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was at Che-
quers last week-end. They said they regarded with "growing anger" the "gross and
unconstitutional" interference by Sir Roy's Federal Government in the talks.
