The most convenient one for the authors has been the text of A. Souter. In this
version of the text the Fourth Gospel is printed as just over 1,000 different nouns,
verbs, and other parts of speech occurring 15,695 times in their different grammatical
forms. There are other texts which could have been used, and (as shown in Table 1)
it is not a matter of the greatest importance which text is used.
