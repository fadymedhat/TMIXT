So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and long brown hair in a bun at the
back of her head remained a mystery until later the following day. During that time
a description of the girl was circulated, and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
identify her as his sister, Mary Money, aged twenty-two. The girl, who was described
as being "always bright and jolly," had been unmarried, and lived at Lavender Hill,
Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for whom she worked as a book-
keeper.
