Prizes being what they are, Berlin is unusually generous in giving everyone something,
and silver bears are awarded in every direction. Both the Antonioni and Wicki films
took high honours, and the audience at the awards was particularly enthusiastic when
one Miss Anna Kerima was selected as best actress for her work in the Godard film.
Gifted with an interesting face, although little acting ability, she would seem to be
well worth watching in the months to come.
