To complete the job, screw two fittings to the inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2
in. from the back to hold the baby's safety harness. These can be made by shaping
and soldering two pieces of stout wire as shown in Fig. 6. Make sure that these are
well secured as they will have to withstand considerable pulling as the child becomes
older.
