We went straight to bed and slept until the turtle-doves drummed up the sun. The
next morning, in the square opposite Pierre's, I read about the Nice beach catastrophe
in the Patriote. Mart had been right, the body had been a woman's. It belonged to
a Madame N. Enquiries had been made in the neighbourhood, and it transpired that
Madame N's husband had made an arrangement with the dead lady's sister to launch
her into the strong sea and there be left to perish.
