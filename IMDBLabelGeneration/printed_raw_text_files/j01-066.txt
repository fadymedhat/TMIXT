The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas via the tube L which must of
course be electrically isolated after this has been carried out. It is not suggested that
the above proposal will be successful but rather that it is worth a trial in the event of
the inadequacy of some simpler method of monitoring the oxygen in a sodium circuit.
The principal difficulty encountered by the author, in determining partial molal free
energies by solid electrolyte cells of very stable oxides such as UO2, MnO etc. was
vapour phase transfer of oxygen by carbonaceous impurities in the blanket gas.
