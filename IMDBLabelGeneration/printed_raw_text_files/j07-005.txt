The air passages were packed with corrugated foil bonded to the primary plates to
provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer. The narrower coolant passages
were also packed with foil, chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to
withstand the coolant pressure loadings. The introduction of the aluminium alloy dip-
brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up for aircraft heat exchangers
and led to substantial weight reductions as compared with copper construction.
