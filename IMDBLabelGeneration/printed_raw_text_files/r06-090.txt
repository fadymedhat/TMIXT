It was growing cold. We left the crowd and drove back to Vence. The cool evening
perfumes stood beckoning at the corners of the roads. Mart is unable to smell (her
sense organs were impaired years ago), and I had to explain the low, sharp and sweet
signals in the air. When we got back home we felt exhausted. London sickness (a
sense of guilt, mingled with the memory of sandwiches and incestuous Soho pubs) still
numbed our brains and bodies.
