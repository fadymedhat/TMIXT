'To rule is to serve, woman. Those who bear power are slaves to it. Only an outcast is
free. Because we are Captives, we have the time to talk and think and plan and know.
Those who know command the knives of others.' 'No hurt will come to you, Lily-yo,'
Band Appa Bondi added. 'You will live among us and enjoy your life free from harm.'
