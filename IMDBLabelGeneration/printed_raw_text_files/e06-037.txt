The East Anglian behaviour (see p. 82) has always differed from that of the summer
fisheries. There is the "swim" at slack waters, even in daylight sometimes; and the
high swimming, when fish are caught only in the top few yards of netting. These and
other fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar to this fishery, which unfortunately
seems to be dying out; but a full discussion of them is beyond the present scope.
