Potter screamed during an action, and was arrested. He claimed he had seen a vision
of God - only the padre and his C O believed him. Courtenay played the part with a

obstinate, baffled eyes. They stripped him of his ugly battle-dress, to leave him for
what he was - Potter, a frightened boy who had a vision.
