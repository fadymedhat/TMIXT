ministration's sharpened policies, the speeded-up drive to improve West Germany's
armament, the new attempt to rush Britain into the European Common Market, and
the kite-flying on Spain present a whole new proof that to abandon Scarborough is
to expose Britain and her working class to sharp new dangers - that Gaitskellism is
bankrupt.
