Yes. I'm afraid we couldn't raise this loan to more than three thousand three fifty at
the most. Now you could get quite a nice little semi-detached house in Grimstead for
three thousand, that's where I live, just before the green belt, lovely and modern, you
know. I forgot to tell you, we don't usually lend any house built earlier than 1918."
