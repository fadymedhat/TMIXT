Oversew crochet to the dc. A household word, Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qual-
ities which are of the utmost importance to the worker. It washes beautifully, never
loses its colour nor becomes 'stringy', is very elastic and preserves the beauty of the
design. It is easy to work with, soft, glossy and of uniform thickness - it is the ideal
crochet thread.
