There is, however, a danger that workers will rely too much on fixed devices because
they fail to recognise their limitations. It is therefore safer both in principle and
practice to keep the worker away from overhead lines wherever possible, e.g., by (1)
re-routing the line, (2) putting the supply underground, (3) making the line dead (after
consultation with the supply authority), (4) providing barriers at a safe distance to
prevent vehicles from approaching the line, or height gauges or "goal posts" at points
where vehicles must pass below the line, (5) providing look-out men or banksmen.
