It was the battered and broken body of a woman. He sent word straight away to
near-by Merstham Station, and a stretcher party took the body to the Feathers Hotel
to await identification. Was it a case of suicide, where some unhappy soul had walked
deliberately into the blackness and into the path of some train? This hardly seemed
likely, since, when she was examined by a local doctor, the woman, young, small, and
rather plump, was found to have her own silk scarf drawn almost tight enough to
strangle her, and the ends thrust in her mouth like a gag.
