Certainly, the rise is very small. But it is a step in the direction of live-and-let-live. Hopes
will now grow brighter of further international co-operation, which is the only way
to solve the payments difficulties that upset the Western world. Britain and the
U.S., which have problems with their balances, will gain some immediate help. What
it means in practical terms is that our exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
for Germans to buy, while the goods which Germany exports will be made a little
dearer.
