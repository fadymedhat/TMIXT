The development corporations have provided office accommodation (in addition to
that included in factory premises) in the form of buildings specially designed to meet
the needs of particular organisations, and have also erected some buildings as a spec-
ulative venture. Despite some misgivings, these have readily let on satisfactory terms,
including in many cases a break clause in the lease allowing for a future increase in
rent to reflect rising values in the town.
