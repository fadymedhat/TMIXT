Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin with what we have called a
bare minimum kit. Probably most men have some of the tools already. It will enable
a man to make simple, straight-forward things, and in any case may be regarded as
a good beginning to which other tools can be added as the need arises. The nature
of the work will probably dictate the additions to be made, but as a guide we have
given a fuller kit which increases the range of things that can be made enormously.
