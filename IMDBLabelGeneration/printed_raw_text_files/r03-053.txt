His voice was like his black and pin-stripe, a grey superimposition of respectability
over the original colour of his own natural vowels, the result being somehow as in-
effective, not just dusty-grey but muddy, slimy even. His digressions too, seemed to
have no other purpose than the throwing of dust in his client's eyes, the dust of fake
security, of the fake friend of the family, like the puffs from his Gauloises, which said
'Don't you worry your fluffy little head about that, just lull back in the layers of my
experience,' as he told her how he had saved one of his clients from buying a house
in which he somehow owned all the bricks and mortar but not the joists, which had
been omitted from the Deeds, and how he had learnt from another client who was
a greengrocer that all greengrocers cheat the income-tax by a complicated system of
unrecorded purchases which has become the norm at Covent Garden.
