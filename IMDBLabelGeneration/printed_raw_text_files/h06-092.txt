A new method of applying sand to the faces of green bricks has recently been devel-
oped. In the case of wire-cut bricks the column of clay from the pug-mill is carried
by a short length of belt conveyor to the sanding plant. This consists basically of a
vibrating hopper from which the sand is distributed to all four faces by a system of
slots, scrapers and worms.
