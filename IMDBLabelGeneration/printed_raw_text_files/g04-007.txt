The Hall proved most useful, especially in winter when the distance to the church
deterred many from coming to Sunday Evensong. We managed to furnish a table
with cross and candles, and the people appreciated the Church Hall for worship as
well as for more secular purposes. In 1910 Dr. Talbot was translated to Winchester,
and Dr. Hubert Burge became Bishop of Southwark.
