During the sixteenth century a considerable amount of crochet was produced in the
convents of Europe. Without doubt it was the nuns who carried the craft to Ireland.
There it was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive form with rosettes,
leaves and lace fillings. During the time of Victoria this gentle craft was greatly
abused.
