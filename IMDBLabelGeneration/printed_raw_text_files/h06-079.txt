The equipment takes two forms - an insulating guard on the jib of the crane, intended
to prevent direct contact with the line, and electronic equipment with a sensitive
probe mounted slightly forward of the head of the jib and with electronic assembly
and warning apparatus in the driver's cab. Improved designs of both forms are being
tried out at present.
