One can remember with horror the pictures of the overcrowded and over-embellished
drawing-rooms complete with heavy crochet antimacassars, mantelpiece covers with
a fringing of clumsy bobbles and numerous other crocheted pieces. It was some years
after the Victorian period that designers realised the potentialities of the craft, and
crochet was revived with designs suitable for contemporary trends. Crochet today
has a variety of uses, and has even stepped into the field of high fashion.
