Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts (seats) taking care to reinforce the sides
of the dinghy at the seats with vertical members as shown in the plans. Make the
four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions before riveting on the gunwales
so that you do not put a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside (gunwale)
one to fit the block.
