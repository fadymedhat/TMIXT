Yesterday West German Defence Minister, Herr Strauss, started talks with the British
Defence Minister, Mr. Watkinson. Their talks are another stage in the cloak oper-
ation, 1961 variety, by which the West German militarists are advancing their rear-
mament. Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October that his policy was to make
his country the "strongest militarily in Europe and the United States' principal Nato
ally."
