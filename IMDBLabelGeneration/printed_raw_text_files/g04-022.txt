After the First World War, 1914, I did not visit Germany for ten years, by which time
in 1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey. Towards the end of my five and a half
years' incumbency I was asked if I would start a village choral society and conduct it.
This opened up a new interest, and we plunged into it.
