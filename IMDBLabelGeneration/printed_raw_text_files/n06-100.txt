With something of a start I remembered the man who'd brought us into this business.
"Maybe you don't know about Appleton, Dan?" "Know what?" "That he's dead," I
said. I watched him because I was always fascinated by the way he looked when you
tried to surprise him. "Dead?" he said. "Yes. Dead. Shuffled out of the deck. Blasted
down with a shotgun outside the Palace last night."
