Formula One, which appeared in February, appeared to make this likely; Formula Two,
which appeared in June, made it very unlikely; if Formula Three restores the original
principle, that is all that need be required of it. It is a pity that the Government
should ever have been led away from this principle. It is a great pity that the Gov-
ernment should give the appearance of responding, not to Mr Kaunda's reasonable
representations, but to the violence which he tried to prevent.
