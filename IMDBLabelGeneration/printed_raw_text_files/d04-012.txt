The word Shamir was used as a personal name (Git. 68a). The Hebrew word
"SHAMIR" means guarded or preserved. Therefore, the real man, who regards him-
self as insignificant, as the prayer says: "What am I? A worm", he is the Shamir and
such a man fulfils the Shmah, loves the Lord God with all his heart, and with all his
soul and with all his might and studies the word of God.
