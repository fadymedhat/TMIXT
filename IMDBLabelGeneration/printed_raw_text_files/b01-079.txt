It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr. Hammarskjold and the UN's servants. The
responsibility rightly belongs to the nations which have undertaken the task of pre-
serving peace in the Congo. That is not a ceremonial duty, and the soldiers have every
right to blame the politicians unless they see it through. When the United Nations
instructed Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to prevent civil war, it was
clear that new dangers would arise unless it gave him the physical power to comply
with the policy.
