Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen: (a) Button Stitch round the
outline of basting stitches, the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the outside
edge. Oversew crochet to button stitch. (b) Turn under a small hem, with fold lying
on line of basting stitches. Work a row of dc all round this hem, with 3 dc at each
corner.
