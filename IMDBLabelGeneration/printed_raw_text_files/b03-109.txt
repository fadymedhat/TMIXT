Can it be shown that the one scale is demonstrably better than the other? The
centigraders may be in for a stiffer fight than they think. They may have to call up
the reinforcement of the Common Market. Even then it might be easier to persuade
the British public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain circumstances the time
would come when this would suit their convenience - rather than to change their
system of recording temperatures.
