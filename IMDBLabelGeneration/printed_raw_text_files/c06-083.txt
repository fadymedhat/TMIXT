not too well designed for sleeping in, and Rock Hudson at the wheel of a shining silver
Rolls-Royce. Mr. Hudson is an American millionaire who spends each September in
his Italian villa and the company of Signorina Lollobrigida. In the holiday seasonal
months before and after this annual idyll his major-domo (Walter Slezak at his most
nauseating) turns the palazzo into a luxury hotel.
