I slept soundly, and much later than I should. It was already after six when I awoke,
and the sun was nearly setting beyond the west window. Downstairs I could hear the
murmur of voices, and knew they were back. I wondered, as I wrapped a 6sarong
around my waist, if Nigel at all resented being deprived of his afternoon sleep.
