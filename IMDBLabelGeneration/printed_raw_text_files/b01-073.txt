The first reaction of the Sudanese Government was to denounce the United Nations
for "negligence and impotence," and to say that its 400 troops in the Congo would
be taken home. The reaction can be understood. The Sudan's concern for its men is
natural. But this could hardly be a dignified exit. IF the UN is blamed for being weak,
it would be more logical to send in more men, not weaken it further by desertion.
