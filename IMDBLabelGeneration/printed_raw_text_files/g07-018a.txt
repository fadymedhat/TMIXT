It may have been then that Trelawny contrived to do his copying. Considering that
Pietro was not above twenty-three years of age when he undertook a load of heavy
responsibilities, his conduct reveals him as one of the most intelligent as well as the
most sympathetic of Byron's 6entourage in Greece. With his good looks - for he
'carried the passport of a very handsome person' - his good manners and his perfect
lack of pretension, he even succeeded in disarming Hobhouse's possessiveness and
making him forget how deeply he had disapproved, less than two years ago in Italy, of
the immoral way the Countess Guiccioli's family accepted Byron as her lover.
