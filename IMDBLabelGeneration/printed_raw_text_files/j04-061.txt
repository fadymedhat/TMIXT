The glass tube is 11 cm. long and 1 cm. in internal diameter. One end of the tube
is drawn down to a fine tip and a B14 conical glass socket is fitted to the other end
as shown in Figure 1. The reservoir is a 50 ml cylindrical separating funnel with a
capillary tap modified by the addition of a B14 cone to fit the glass column.
