But this time there was a very interesting attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
payments demanded. The definition of an adult was altered to read 'over sixteen',
and, where the poorest were to pay a groat, the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks, and between these two extremes a
graduated scale of payments was fixed for the different classes of laymen and clerics.
