At one time it was thought that mind could indeed be analysed into discrete bits.
These bits were identified as elementary sensations. These were thought to combine
together to form compound experiences by analogy with the way atoms of matter
combine to form molecular compounds. But this view led to too many difficulties and
was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search for basic units of mind has gone on
and will doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to discover ultimate units.
