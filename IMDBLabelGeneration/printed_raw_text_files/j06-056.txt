Loeb first suggested the importance of light as the governing factor but combined
its influence with that of gravity. Later authors, in particular Rose, have proposed
that light alone can provide an adequate mechanism if the animals have, and select
by exploration, a zone of optimum light intensity. This view has been enlarged with
a suggestion that both phototaxes and geotaxes may play a part in keeping animals
near their optimum.
