The weekend conference for the men and their wives, which takes place at company
expense in a country or resort hotel, includes an address on 'The Woman's Point of
View' and one on 'Making the Most of Health'. Separate discussions are arranged for
the wives in addition to the plenary sessions. Of the men reaching fifty years of age
since the scheme started, 125 (37.2 per cent) have taken part.
