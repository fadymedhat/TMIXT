The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to West Germany were published
in Moscow yesterday. They tell: The U.S. - It is false to say the absence of a peace
treaty with Germany causes no real danger. West Germany, with its militarists and
revenge-seekers, is becoming a hotbed of war danger in Europe. Even now, aided by
the U.S., Britain and France, it has more than enough forces and arms to touch off a
world war.
