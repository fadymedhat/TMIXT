The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue, which is written on two plates, the hard
facts of life, and all facts are "one". We have all come across human Shamirs and they
leave a deep impression on our feelings and senses. They make us the Altar for God
to emit the Light which can be read in every language. The Shamir is the "seventh"
and most important creature, that was created on the eve of the Sabbath, to bring
the Sabbath, real peace to the whole world.
