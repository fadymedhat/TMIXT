Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys, Commonwealth Relations
Secretary, that they wish to be kept in touch in London. Three of them - Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening meeting in
London on Monday. Once the Common Market's Council of Ministers draws up the
procedure for negotiations in a fortnight's time, these Commonwealth countries can
arrange for observers to advise the British negotiating team.
