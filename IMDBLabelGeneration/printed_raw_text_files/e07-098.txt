Seed is sown, or seedlings are pricked out into them in the normal way, the only real
difference being that more of the watering is done through a rose to avoid breaking
the blocks with a spout of water. First-class plants of tomatoes, cucumbers, marrows,
melons, cauliflowers, celery and onions, may all be raised in soil blocks; so can such
flowering plants as dahlias, chrysanthemums, salvias, sweet peas, lupins and numerous
others.
