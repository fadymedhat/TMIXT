One called La Patriote is Communist, and at the time of our arrival it was throwing
huge over-ripe verbal tomatoes at General de Gaulle. One side of this square is a
smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar. For one day, with the help of the Syndicat
d'Initiative, we had been hunting for furnished rooms, and had given up, when an
elderly lady, the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest, had firmly closed the
door in our noses.
