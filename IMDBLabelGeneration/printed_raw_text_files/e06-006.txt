The effect of bottom congestion due to the light pressure is inevitably mixed with
that of the suitability of ground for spawning. Both result in crowding, so there is no
need to try to separate them - thank Heaven! A good picture of this is seen on the
150 miles of spawning grounds from the Viking in the north down to the Klondykes
and the Reef along the western edge of the Norwegian Deep.
