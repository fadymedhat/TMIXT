The presence of 75 of bismuth-210 is equivalent to ingrowth over two half-lives (ten
days). Therefore after a further forty days, the bismuth daughter will be within
0.1%sources are required for use sooner than forty or fifty days after preparation, the
lead-210 together with added lead carrier must be separated from the bismuth-210
daughter by ion exchange (see Analytical Method, steps 4, 5) before precipitating
lead chromate.
