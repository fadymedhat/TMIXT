Let us consider first what would appear to be the simplest case - that of flat fish
on the bottom. The evidence suggest that the fish are aware of the moving footrope
before it reaches them. They move away before it, swimming at the same speed for
an unknown period of time, until they become (1) tired, or (2) more used to the
disturbance.
