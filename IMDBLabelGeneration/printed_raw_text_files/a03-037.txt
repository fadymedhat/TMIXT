Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative provincial governments, Quebec and New
Brunswick, and in the four federal by-elections last October the party fared badly.
They are now faced with four other by-elections, one at Esquimalt Saanich, British
Columbia, one in Leeds, Ontario, and the other two in the Maritimes - Restigouche
Madawaska, New Brunswick, and Kings, Prince Edward Island.
