The trouble about such debates is that they range too widely. They remind one of
the Rugby match in "Tom Brown's Schooldays," in which all the boys were welcome
to take part, and only those who "really meant business" removed their jackets. Not
many metaphorical braces were visible in the early stages of to-night's debate. Mr.
Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's golf-course Press conference, which
he described as "a display of flabby and fatuous complacency which takes us straight
back to Neville Chamberlain."
