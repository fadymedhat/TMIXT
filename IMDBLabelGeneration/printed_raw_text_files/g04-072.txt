Indeed, for the next seventeen years, during my time at Purley, and from 1922 at
Surbiton, I was continuously Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee. This
task involved a very great deal of detailed work for the Committee. We had a splendid
body of local residents, and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries. Our Committee
met once a week in the evenings, and included professional men from every walk of
life.
