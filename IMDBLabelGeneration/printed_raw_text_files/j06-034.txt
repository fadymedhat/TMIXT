2. Mechanisms. The majority of vertical migrations undoubtedly result from active
swimming although passive movement through the water has been suggested on vari-
ous grounds. For example, transport in vertical currents resulting from temperature
differences has been proposed; differences in water viscosity after temperature changes
have also been suggested as a cause of movement, and passive movement could possibly
result from changes in the specific gravity of the animals as a result of feeding.
