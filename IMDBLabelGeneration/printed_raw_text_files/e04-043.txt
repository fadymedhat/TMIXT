Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little rowing dinghy many of which I have
built and sold. It is especially designed for simplicity in construction, cheapness and
lightness of weight, and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She weighs only 60
lb. but can carry three people and an outboard motor with a comfortable margin of
freeboard.
