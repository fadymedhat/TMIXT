A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within a few miles of Vang Vieng was
told by officers that this village was still held by the pro-communists. With the
Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica and his Cabinet out in the grass roots
making 160 speeches in 80 constituencies in 10 days, the Liberal Party are holding a
national conference here with some 2,000 delegates, the biggest gathering since 1958
when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party leader.
