We didn't approach unchallenged. Just short of the diggings there was a roughly-built
shack and as we got near someone inside bawled out, "If you come any closer, I'll sure
blow your whiskers off." "Take it easy, mister," I sang out. "We don't aim to come
any closer and we've got no whiskers so as you can see. Just you go and tell Nick
Dowd we've come to talk to him about what happened last night."
