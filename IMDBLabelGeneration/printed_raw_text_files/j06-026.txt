In view of its well-known normal migration, the occurrence of Calanus finmarchicus
in the summer at the surface in bright sunlight may justly be considered anoma-
lous. This phenomenon has nevertheless been recorded many times, and such surface
Calanus may be present in enormous numbers, breaking the surface into small circu-
lar ripples like raindrops. Observed underwater, two zones of differing behavior were
recognized: an upper one about 30 cm in depth, in which the Calanus swam up and
down repeatedly, frequently bumping on the undersurface of the water, and a lower
one of indeterminate depth in which animals swam directly up or down.
