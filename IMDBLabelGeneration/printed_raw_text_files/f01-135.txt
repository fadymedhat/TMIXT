It is the tendency to get things the wrong way round. As a psychologist I am con-
stantly encountering this tendency in friends and acquaintances. They think there is
something inevitably "queer" about psychology and this feeling of queerness usually
boils down to a quite mistaken belief that the psychologist first looks into his own
mind and then interprets other people's minds by what he has found in his own.
