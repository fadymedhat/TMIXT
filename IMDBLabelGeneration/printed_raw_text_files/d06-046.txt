Even more simply, test your own reactions to different situations. There are some
which bring on an almost immediate feeling of tiredness - such as when your wife
mentions the washing-up - while others, if they refer to something you like doing,
bring a veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who is 'too tired to help mum' will
later jump up with no apparent tiredness at all when her boy friend calls and go for
a long walk.
