And the sequence in the text is different than in the first part of the Shmah, we have
first "and to bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets
between your eyes." First to bind them to have the vision and then "And 1ye shall
teach them to your children." And as we have gone through the mill, we need not
teach them to the children any more diligently and the children will grasp now what
will befall them without visionary power.
