But why woodwork in particular? Well, there are many reasons. Wood is in good
and common supply; it lends itself to making innumerable useful household items -
furniture, fitments, garden items, toys, etc.; it enables results to be obtained fairly
quickly; it is less expensive than most other materials; it is a pleasant material to
work with; and, although it does create a certain amount of mess, it is all clean and
easily cleared away.
