(Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved; it may be by actual contact, or
by sight reaction to the disturbed sand; or even in the case of flat fish, by vibrations
through or along the bottom.) But given such a bow wave of disturbance, it is obvious
that without something to overcome its effect, very few fish would be caught.
