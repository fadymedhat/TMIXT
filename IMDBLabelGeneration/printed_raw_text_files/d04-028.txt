"For the stone shall cry out of the wall", like Baalam's ass, "and the purlin of timber
shall creak in answer" "if the roof of our security is crushing our soul" (see Hab.
2, 10-11). And it is through the Shamir: "That the earth shall be filled with the
knowledge of the Glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." (Hab. 2, 14.)
