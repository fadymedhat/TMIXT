There can be little doubt that if the Thetans discover our mental independence they
will promptly give us their hypnotic treatment. If we can avoid undue prominence,
it may be that we can move about pretty freely without detection. If we can - well,
then we may be able to promote our own interests. What those interests are, beyond
personal security, I haven't a clue; but, who knows, we may form the nucleus around
which some sort of resistance movement may be built.
