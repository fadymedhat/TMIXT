Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the plan measurements but leave suf-
ficient margin for planing after fixing to the boat. Use your two lengths of 8 ft. by 4
ft. ply for this purpose, the sides from one, and the bottom from the other. If care is
taken not to waste the ply, plenty of material is left over for the thwarts.
