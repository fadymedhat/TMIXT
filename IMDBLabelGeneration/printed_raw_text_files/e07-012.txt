From the day it hatches in the spring until it dies in the late autumn, the praying
mantis satisfies its voracity by eating other insects. Nine blowflies may be consumed
at one sitting and the fully adult, 2 1/2-in.-long insect, is able to keep a firm hold on one
grasshopper while eating another. According to Dr. Max Beier in "Fangheuschrecken"
(Die Neue Brehm Bu"ckerei, 1952), the praying mantis is trecking northwards.
