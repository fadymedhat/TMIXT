In the days when most people were born, lived and died within the boundaries of
the village, it was not difficult for anybody to live a day at a time. Even those who
held a high and responsible office lived in far greater simplicity than their successors.
When news from the Continent took days, from America weeks, from the Far East,
months, even a Prime Minister could go to sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
be happening at the other end of England, whereas today, everybody, let alone the
Prime Minister, knows of happenings the other side of the world, within minutes of
their taking place.
