PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough over West Germany's cash offer to
help America's balance of payments position. He said bluntly in Washington yester-
day that the offer - 357million - was not good enough. And he indicated that his
Government would try to get Germany to pay more. He did not mention personal
talks with Dr. Adenauer, the West German Chancellor.
