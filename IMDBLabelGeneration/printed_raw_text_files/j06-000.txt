All stages of Calanus, for example, seem to migrate on some occasions while any stage
may not on others. Such data cannot yet be rationalized. Where information is less
extensive, however, it is possible to find some regularity in the observations. Thus in
Euphausia superba from the Antarctic, the metanauplii remain in deep water, the later
larval stages migrate diurnally, and the adolescents stay permanently at the surface.
