This emphasis on the legality of the former Government suggests that all is not well
with the political and military leadership of the pro-communists. Most of the province
of Xieng Khouang and the tactically useful Plain of Jars, however, appear still to be
firmly in their hands. The Government has claimed the recapture of Vang Vieng, the
pro-communists' former base 60 miles north of Vientiane, but this claim had been
made before the end of last month.
