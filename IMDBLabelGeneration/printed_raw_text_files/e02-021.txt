Incidentally, it is better to complete any mortising that may be needed at the top
before the tapering is begun. Some plain tapered legs have the taper on the two inner
faces only, the outer surfaces being vertical as at (B), Fig. 1. To make a leg such as
that at (D), Fig. 1, the square is first marked out as at (A), Fig. 3.
