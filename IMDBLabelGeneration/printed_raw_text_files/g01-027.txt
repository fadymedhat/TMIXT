In appreciating this story, modern conceptions of governmental duties must be set
aside. A modern government needs taxation not merely for defence and offence but
for a very wide range of social services. A mediaeval oligarchy needed taxation in
order to supplement the private wealth of the monarchy (the royal income from the
revenues of crown lands, the fees of feudalism and the fines of justice) and to provide
enough cash to meet royal expenses, and especially the expenses of waging war.
