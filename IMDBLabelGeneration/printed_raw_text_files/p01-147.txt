Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side of the church where there was a small
open outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades and forks and tidying up
implements. It might be open. It was. He entered, and seated himself in a huddle
upon an upturned wheelbarrow. His curious headgear fell off. Strange things were
going on in his bewildered brain. When a man was drowning and towards his last
gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole life came up before him in some cinematic
kind of sequence.
