What seems certain is that those who advocate putting off any approach until Mr
Krushchev gives evidence of a change of heart (whatever that may mean) would
have us run risks greater than the West ought to run - and greater than President
Kennedy's most influential advisers seem disposed to face. The real question is what
we should put to the Soviet Government as a basis for talks: and that means working
out what we know to be the essential interests of the West in Berlin and what we
suppose that the Soviet Government may now be after.
