The Lord Provost, having studied the report on 'The Morale and Health of Retired
Workers', and being satisfied that the matters raised were of considerable importance
to the citizens of Glasgow and warranted further study, set an informal committee
representative of bodies particularly concerned with the welfare of older people to
examine the report and its implications and to consider the advisability of arranging
a Conference on Preparation for and Occupational Activities on Retirement.
