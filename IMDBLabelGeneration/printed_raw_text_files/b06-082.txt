The statement of Padley and Crossman is no different in principle to the new defence
statement. They accept American nuclear bases, and also the use of nuclear weapons
and nuclear strategy until some future date. They deceive the people by their talk
of political and collective control of Nato. The Pentagon has made it perfectly clear
who controls the American H-bomb, and who will actually give the instructions to
press the button for nuclear warfare.
