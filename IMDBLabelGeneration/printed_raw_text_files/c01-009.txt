The production by Bill Duncalf compressed a long and sometimes rambling story
into a concentrated comprehensive survey of a life work. P. J. K. HANS WERNER
HENZE'S "Elegy for Young Lovers" is the first unambiguously "contemporary" work
to be admitted to the Glyndebourne canon. By no means a masterpiece, it is in
many respects a representative modern work and the composer is a highly skilled
manipulator of contemporary idioms, with a strong sense of words and situation.
