We also had a little Mission Hall leading off the Brighton Road, in a street full of small
houses. This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went there, but was soon changed
into the better-sounding name of Lansdowne Road. There were lots of children there,
and we had a flourishing Sunday School and an evening service. I soon saw that the
parish needed more help both at the church and Mission district.
