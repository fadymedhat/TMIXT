Toyohiko Kagawa. Loving Saviour, who experienced all human emotion, and whose
sensitive nature knows better than we do, what it is to be really afraid, help us to
know that when we face life boldly, many of the shadows are seen to be allies and not
enemies and that, come what may, we are never alone when we are with Thee.
