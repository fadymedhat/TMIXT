Cut this piece of hardboard so that it fits up against the front legs of the chair. The
seat rests across the upper two cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood glued and
panel pinned in position, measurements being taken directly from the work. Fig. 4
shows the framework for the back which is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber.
