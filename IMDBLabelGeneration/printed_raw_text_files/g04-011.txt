Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan work in connection with Higher
Religious Education, and to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
Union. This meant organizing lectures and courses of religious instruction through
the Diocese, and I also found myself a member of the Diocesan Conference, where I
remember introducing myself as the incumbent of the highest church in the Diocese.
