In the preliminary experiments, the tracer was added to a liter of effluent and imme-
diately coprecipitated with strontium sulphate from hot solution. Chemical exchange
was complete under these conditions; but when the tracer was added to alkaline ef-
fluent and allowed to stand for several days before the addition of lead carrier, the
recovery of lead-210 was as much as five per cent low when corrected for gravimetric
recovery of the carrier.
