I am more than conscious of this. How anybody can go through the same routine day
in and day out for forty years I find difficult to understand. A lot of it is inevitable so
that industry and commerce may be kept going - though if ever it becomes possible
to work out a system of 'staggered' hours it may do an immense amount of good over
and above relieving the pressure on over-crowded trains.
