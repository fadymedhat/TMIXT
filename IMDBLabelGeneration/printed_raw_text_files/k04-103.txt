In this region of Monti most of the public baths had been built in the time of the
Caesars, but with the breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions the
baths had lost their purpose; they had become stone quarries and their precious
marble had been burnt for lime. Now escaped criminals and bandits used these
quarries as hiding places, to the danger of travellers in the district.
