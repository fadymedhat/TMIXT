A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of Buganda (King Freddie) from Princess Elizabeth
Bagaya of Toro, kneeling at the foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport yesterday.
Forty other Africans greeted him, kneeling with heads bowed. The princess, aged 24,
is now studying history at Cambridge, where she is a friend of Prince William of
Gloucester.
