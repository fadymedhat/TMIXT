Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks, followed by lunch given by Lady
Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other guests present, Mr. Kennedy and
Mr. Macmillan met three more times yesterday. In PARIS, Mr. Dean Rusk, U.S.
Secretary of State, gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the 15-nation
Nato council. Some of his listeners said he was "rather pessimistic" and talked of a
Berlin crisis later this year.
