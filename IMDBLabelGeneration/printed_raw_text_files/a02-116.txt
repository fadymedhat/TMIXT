It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which ended yesterday in 32 members
of the Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting a breach of the peace. The
committee's president 89-year-old Earl Russell and his 61-year-old wife were each
jailed for a week. Playwrights Arnold Wesker (The Kitchen) and Robert Bolt (The
Flowering Cherry) were jailed for a month.
