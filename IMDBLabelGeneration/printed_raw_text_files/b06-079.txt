It is impossible for Labour's new Defence statement to unite the movement as the
Labour leaders are not only in favour of American bases, but are in favour of German
bases and troops being trained on British soil. The new Defence statement, while
accepting that Britain cannot remain an independent nuclear Power, now supports the
policy of depending on American nuclear weapons and the H-bomb, placing Britain
in an even more dangerous position.
