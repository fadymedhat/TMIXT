Social service as a function of government was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
substitute was the mutual self-help of communities, whether those communities were
monasteries, manors, townships, or wards and guilds of a city. A mediaeval tax was
therefore in essence a forced payment whose return was the uncertain bounty of booty
and the vague advantages of military glory; it was therefore always granted grudgingly
and coupled with the vain hope that, in the words of Parliament after Parliament,
the King might 'live of his own resources and carry on his war'.
