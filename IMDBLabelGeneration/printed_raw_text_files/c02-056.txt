This director is at last being re-evaluated and given his proper place in the history of
the German film. Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek "Unheimliche Geschichten"
(1920), five ghost stories with a light touch, and there was much to admire in "Drey-
fus" (1930) and the virtually unknown but extremely important "1914" (1931), which
tries to show that it took more than just Germany to start the First World War.
