This man was known to have left his home on February 11, and to have been away
for four days. Not in itself a crime, but, added to the knowledge that he had gone
shopping in the town of Guildford for a false moustache, it left him with something
to explain. His story was that he had left home to try to join the Army (presumably
feeling that a moustache might enhance his military bearing), and this was accepted.
