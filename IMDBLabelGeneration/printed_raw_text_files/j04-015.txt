Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate precipitates need be known because
the concentration of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the algebraic equations.
An effort was made to detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in the tracer
by separating the lead-210 and the bismuth-210 by anion exchange. The 15b-counting
of the lead-210 fraction began within a few minutes of completing the separation.
