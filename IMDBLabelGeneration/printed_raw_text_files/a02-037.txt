The urge came from a conference of activists of Nkrumah's Convention Party "after
powerful addresses by Comrades Krobo Edusei, Tawia Adamafio," and others. Strong
deeds followed strong words. In Takoradi a "limited state of emergency" was declared,
giving the Government adequate power to maintain all essential services and ensure
food supplies. Thus it becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment for anyone
who "publishes a report likely to cause alarm or prejudicial to public safety."
