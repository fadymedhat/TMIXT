And a fine old fuss there was about it, too. Here are the known facts. On 10th
July, the bus, the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl, left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual.
Aboard, apart from the crew, were Mrs. Megan Thomas and her five-year-old son
Cadwallader; pretty little Morfydd Owen; Mr. Stanley Hayball and Miss Ethel Yates,
hikers from Birmingham; Price the Provisions; and the Rev. Edwards.
