part, Mr. Godber muttered his way through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office brief. He
resembles the elephant seal, an otherwise endearing creature whose articulation is

Leicester N.E., a former Labour Solicitor-General, and Mrs. Barbara Castle, M.P.
for Blackburn, a member of the Labour party National Executive, delivered a letter
to Mr. Soldatov, the Russian Ambassador, last night protesting against the Russian
nuclear tests.
