As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence, though we found it an advantage
in certain instances. Appendix 1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted.
The Department of Health for Scotland, the Home Office and the Ministry of Health
submitted evidence to us; officers of these Departments attended our meetings and
have given us valuable assistance.
