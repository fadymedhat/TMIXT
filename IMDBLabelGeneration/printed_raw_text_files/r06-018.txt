The flat was on the third floor; two rooms; soft Provenc*?6al view; good intimate
furnishing and colour; running hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up,
basin and bidet; own private, modern lavatory. The first night's sleeping was like
a long convalescence. We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft eruption of
turtle-doves.
