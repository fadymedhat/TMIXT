The Gemara continues with a saying of the Palestinian teacher, R. Eleazar (3rd Cent.):
'The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places: the court of Shem, the court of
Samuel of Ramah, and the court of Solomon.' The place of this saying here is obvious,
it follows naturally on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which deals with a similar
theme.
