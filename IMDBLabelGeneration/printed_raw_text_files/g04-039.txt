My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with his family, and found a very s
uitable house nearby where my mother settled, and eventually died in 1926 at the
age of 92. Dr. Burge was not able to be present at the Institution and Induction
Service in St. Mark's. This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich, Dr.
John Leake, who lived at Blackheath, and was a close friend of ours.
