The storage problem puts clay pots at a definite disadvantage. They are fairly heavy
and difficult things to accommodate and they must have some protection from severe
weather, which can be quite a headache in a small garden. While admitting that
broken pots have on occasions provided artists with delightful studies, there is no
doubt that a pile of badly stacked, half-broken pots is an unlovely sight from any
point of view.
