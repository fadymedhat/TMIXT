But normal movements have been reported also for the same species in the case of
five of these examples and for other species in the same genera for the remaining
Evadne, Daphnia, and Diaptomus. Many forms sometimes migrate and on other
occasions do not, but a few appear to remain permanently at one level. Considering the
widespread incidence of migration in the groups concerned, these may be considered
as anomalous.
