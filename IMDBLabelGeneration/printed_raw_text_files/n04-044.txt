John's father had been a naval officer of the old school; some of his rigid ideas had
been passed on to the second generation. One of these was that an officer should join
a ship, on taking up a new appointment, at nine a.m. precisely, dressed in the modern
equivalent of frock-coat and sword. It would have been acceptable to all concerned
if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in plain-clothes on the previous night,
but ways instilled by martinet parents have a habit of sticking.
