Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's 'Hiawatha's Wedding Feast.' Enthusiasm
grew, and in a few more months we gave a concert at which the accompanist was the
village schoolmaster, and the tenor solo 'Onaway awake' was sung by the Rector.
Friends from Limpsfield, in addition to the villagers, came up, and we were all happy.
