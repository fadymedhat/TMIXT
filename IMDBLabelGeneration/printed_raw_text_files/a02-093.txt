JOHN DICKIE writes: Mr. Macmillan gave top priority to the clash over Northern
Rhodesia on his return from Scotland yesterday. He summoned Mr. Iain Macleod,
Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Duncan Sandys, Commonwealth Relations Secretary for
an hour's talks at Admiralty House. A statement is expected today to hold the door
open for modifications to the new Constitution provided law and order is maintained
in Northern Rhodesia.
