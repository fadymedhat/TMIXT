A guard reported that at East Croydon he had seen what was accepted as the same
couple sitting close together in a first-class compartment of the train from London
Bridge of which he was in charge. The two could have joined this train by taking
one from Victoria and changing at East Croydon. He also believed that they had
still been together at South Croydon, and he remembered that when they reached
Redhill, after passing through Merstham Tunnel, a man who might have been the
companion of the girl had left the train.
