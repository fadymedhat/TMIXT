The body was examined, and it was definitely established that no sexual assault had
taken place. It seemed probable that the motive had been robbery, and this was fur-
ther confirmed when a check was made with the woman's relations in Hounslow. Miss
Camp had been the housekeeper at the Good Intent, a public-house in Walworth. Her
day off was Thursday, and before coming up to London in the evening she had called
on her two sisters, one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the other at Hounslow,
where she kept a shop.
