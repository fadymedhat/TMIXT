The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its brittle nature; even with reasonably careful
handling, the annual losses are often around 10 per cent., and where the handling and
storage facilities are not too good, these losses will be even greater. This does not
necessarily apply to the larger sizes, as they are not quite so fragile as the smaller ones
and are not normally thrown about in quite the same way.
