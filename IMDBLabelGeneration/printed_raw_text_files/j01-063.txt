Evaporation of sodium from the pool C is minimised by a close fitting cylindrical
block of electrolyte J attached to the +ve nickel conductor by nickel circlips. Fixing
and positioning of the probe relative to the coolant stream is effected by tie-bars of
insulating material K joining the vacuum coupling H to the water cooled flange G.
