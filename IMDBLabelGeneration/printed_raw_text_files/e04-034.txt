Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes with plastic wood. Then
thoroughly glasspaper the whole framework and round off any sharp edges (such as
the edge of the seat, feeding tray, etc). Fill the grain with a woodfiller in the usual
way and paint the frame in a suitable pastel shade, using a contrasting colour for the
seat and the back which can be decorated with a suitable nursery transfer.
