The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's play A Taste of Honey opens at the
Leicester Square Theatre tomorrow. It has been produced and directed by Mr. Tony
Richardson, who is also part-author with Miss Delaney of the script, and the great
advantages to be derived from this unity of conception and control are everywhere
apparent.
