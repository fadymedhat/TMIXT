Table 1 shows the decontamination factors obtained experimentally for ten radionu-
clides, accompanied in two instances by radioactive daughters. The decontamination
factor falls below 104 only for Ruthenium-106 and zirconium-95 with their daughters
in the first stage, i.e. the lead chromate source containing the bismuth-210 daughter.
When the second stage (the bismuth phosphate source) is completed, the decontam-
ination factors are exceptionally high.
