For instance, in Canada we use galvanised nails in place of screws. We just bend them
over and clamp firmly by using a hammer on each side. Over here I've always used
brass screws, which are more expensive. The first job is to make your moulds. In Fig.
1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply, but to save money any scrap may be used, and if this is
nailed and glued together strongly, it may be marked and cut to shape later.
