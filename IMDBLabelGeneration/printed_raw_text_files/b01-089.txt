The big Powers involved in the Cold War must of course keep out. The Americans
were justified in diverting naval ships in case non-combatant help was wanted; but
they stressed that there was no intention to intervene in fighting. Yesterday the ships
turned away again, satisfied that they were not required. It is to be hoped that the
UN will be re-established in their port by negotiation and that there will be no more
outrages.
