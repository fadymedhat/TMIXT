The presence and growth of algae in the alkaline effluent does not prevent the recovery
of radio-lead under the prescribed conditions although some radioactivity remains on
the algae until the metathesis has been completed by heating the mixed sulphates
with three separate portions of dilute (1.25 normal) sodium carbonate solution. The
strength of the carbonate solution was chosen after experiments with lead tracer alone
which indicated that less lead was lost than at other concentrations.
