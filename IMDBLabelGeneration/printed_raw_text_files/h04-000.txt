Nevertheless, average net family income was appreciably higher in families with sev-
eral children than in those with only one, many of which were incomplete families
of younger parents with lower earnings, and of course with lower tax reliefs and no
family allowances. The rise in net family incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great-
est for childless couples, especially older couples (probably because of the increase in
retirement pensions), and somewhat greater in small than in large families.
