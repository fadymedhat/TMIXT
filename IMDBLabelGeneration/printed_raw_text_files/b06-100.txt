The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh, opening a few technical college extensions, will
not keep us abreast of the scientific revolution. Out of the 550,000 young people
aged 15-17 starting work in 1960 420,000 (73 per cent) went into unskilled work.
The percentage is expected to swell to 80 next year. The Duke, possibly speaking
from experience, stated: "Most unskilled jobs are reasonably well-paid and many look
attractive."
