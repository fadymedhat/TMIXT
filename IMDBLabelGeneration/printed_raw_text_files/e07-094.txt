Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay pots for plant raising. These are
compressed blocks of compost, made in a specially devised press to simulate roughly
the shape and size of a pot. Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape, they are made
of the same compost as would have been used in a pot, the only difference being that
it is used in a slightly moister condition.
