Previously, while visitors were left out of this analysis it was not considered sufficiently
important to attempt the task of bringing in the members away from home on Census
night, which would be very laborious in the absence of information given at their place
of usual residence. But the need for a more accurate distribution of households by
size as usually constituted had become more important by 1961, and accordingly a
new question was introduced, for private households only, asking for particulars of
persons usually living in the household who were absent on Census night.
