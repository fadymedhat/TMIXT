This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000 worth of jewellery struck me as
ingenious. The play had style, moved at a quick pace and everyone did well. But it was
Mr. Houston's evening. Earlier, on the Palladium show I found Stanley Holloway's
act too long and not particularly entertaining. It was also a mistake to re-book Gene
Detroy and his performing chimpanzees so soon after their previous appearance.
