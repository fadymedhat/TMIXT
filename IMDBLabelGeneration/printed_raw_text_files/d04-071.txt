And we will nail the Divine Law on the door posts of the house and upon the gates.
"That your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land, which
the Lord swear unto your father to give them, as days of HEAVEN ON EARTH"
That means the Kingdom of Messianic Righteousness (Talmud Sanh. 99A).
