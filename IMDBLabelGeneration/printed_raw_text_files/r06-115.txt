Catherine looked at the books lying around his room, and asked if she might borrow
the stories of Isaac Babel to read on the train. Catherine is 13. I suggested she might
find them difficult, but she said, 'Philip reads them, doesn't he?' During the journey
I read newspapers and watched her pretty frowning face as she turned the pages of
Babel, for she was determined to let nothing get between her and her ambition to be
worthy of Philip.
