There was always the spice of an orgy in those Roman feasts, for instance, with all
their peacocks and nightingales' tongues; unreasonable surfeit, too, in the elaborate
fashion of eating brought out of Italy into France, we are told, by Catherine de Medici.
The peasant in those days, as ever, ate sparingly, but generously enough in his own
fashion, save at feast times, when he, too, let himself go; and it was from his simpler
food that the later renaissance of cooking was to come.
