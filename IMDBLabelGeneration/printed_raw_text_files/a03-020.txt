Prince Souvanna's former Minister of Information, Mr. Quinim Pholsena, who claims
to be his representative in Laos, yesterday addressed all officers of the pro-communist
forces occupying the province of Xieng Khouang and emphasized that Prince Sou-
vanna's Government was the only legal one in the country. Prince Souphannouvong,
leader of the pro-communist Neo Lao Haksat Party, also spoke to the officers in the
same terms.
