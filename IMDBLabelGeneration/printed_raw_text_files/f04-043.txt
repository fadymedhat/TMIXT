The porter at the station bore out this description, but the man was not traced.
Perhaps the news of their search got around, for a man did obligingly present himself
at Wandsworth police-station, claiming to have committed the murder - but he was
mentally defective, and, despite his claim to infamy, had been nowhere near the 7.42
that evening.
