Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much co-operation especially with
the other Christian communities. At a large public meeting we launched the project
known as the 'Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund' in whose counsels and committees
I found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help wives and relations
of the soldiers to get their 'Separation' allowances, but soon, alas!, as casualties began
and increased in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions became very
urgent, and I was asked to be Chairman of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.
