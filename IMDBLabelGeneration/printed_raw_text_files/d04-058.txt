And you serve Mammon and God. And you cannot serve two masters, and you
worship self-interest, isolating yourself, under such conditions the goods are your gods.
"And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens, that
there is no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit and lest 1ye perish quickly from
off the good land which the Lord 1giveth you."
