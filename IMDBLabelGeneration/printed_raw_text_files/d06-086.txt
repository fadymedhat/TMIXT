The housewife would find life far less tiring if she made a list, followed a routine
of work rather than getting from one thing to the next. The business man would
find that he reached the end of the day with far less strain if he was a little more
systematic. To drift aimlessly along is more wearying than anything else. If we would
only sit down and write out all the necessary jobs waiting to be done and then work
quietly through them, we would find life considerably less exhausting - and in the end
we would do more.
