(This is probably to be understood as a well-known comment on the verse; quoted by
Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua
b. Levi's thesis!) The proof text of greeting by the divine Name is taken from the
Mishnah. There is no reference to the Mishnah here because the Mishnah deals with
the actual practice of greeting by the divine Name and the Gemara here quotes the
texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi.
