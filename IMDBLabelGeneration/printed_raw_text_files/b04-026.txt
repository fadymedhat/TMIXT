The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in Britain today! "THIS is
colour day," proclaimed the American television network, N.B.C. And hour after
hour it poured out its programmes in bright colours. In America colour TV is five
years old. There are already 600,000 sets in use. What about Britain? The B.B.C.
is ready to launch a colour TV service, but the commercial TV contractors want to
delay it for 10 years.
