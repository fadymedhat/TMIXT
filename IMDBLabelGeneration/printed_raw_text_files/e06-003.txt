Thus we can see that herring movements, although primarily instinctive perhaps, and
certainly helped and hindered by water flow, are also closely related to the sea-bed
geography. Geography, too, names the great fisheries that depend on them: the
Fladen Ground (where again most big shots are taken on the edges), the Gut, a deep-
water channel to the Dogger where the herring spawn along the northern edge; a
good contour map will almost define the migrations of these summer herring.
