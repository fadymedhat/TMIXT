Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom, which is cut in one piece. It should
overlap just a trifle; this can be cleaned up later. As you are screwing and gluing this
piece to the chines it is necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with the screws.
I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for the bottom, both for screwing to the chines
and the bottom shaped transom facing.
