The Bow-wave Theory. This assumes that all fishing gear, when moving, sends before
it a kind of scaring effect, probably through waves or vibrations in the water or along
the ground. Underwater films suggest that the footrope of a trawl does this. Films
have also shown plaice moving before a seine net in just the same way after being
gathered inwards by the ropes.
