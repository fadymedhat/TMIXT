Drift in another form probably explains how these migrating herring are biased to
east or west by the different winds. Strong westerlies are well known to bring good
longshore fishings. The surface water that is blown offshore must be replaced by an
underflow bringing with it the herring to the Norfolk and Suffolk beaches.
