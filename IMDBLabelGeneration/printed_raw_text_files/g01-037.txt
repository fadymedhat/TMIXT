The people - Langland's 'folk' and Gaunt's 'knaves' - were villeins still tied to the
feudal obligations of work or villeins who had bought their release, free labourers who
worked for the highest bidders, free yeomen who had prospered enough to become
successful farmers, the artisans, craftsmen, journeymen and small tradesmen of the
towns, and the retainers and men-at-arms in the pay of landed Lords.
