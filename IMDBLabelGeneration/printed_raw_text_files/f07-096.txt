Wagner was a highly practical feeder. He ate very fast, placing his food in his mouth
and gulping it down as he talked. Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe which
he washed down with beer. A writer who had dinner with Dickens says the menu was
Whitstable oysters, a brown sole, a baked leg of mutton with oyster & veal stuffing and
a gin punch.
