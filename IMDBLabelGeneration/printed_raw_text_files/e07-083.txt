Every garden boy will agree that having to wash clay pots is a definite factor in
favour of their abolition; in fact one young man was so wholehearted about this a few

his feelings. On the small-to-medium establishment, it is a disagreeable chore which
nobody tackles with any enthusiasm, whereas on larger establishments the pots can
be sterilized or washed by machine.
