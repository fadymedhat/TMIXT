Northern Rhodesia is a member of the Federation. Mr. Macleod was not at the
week-end meeting. But he told M Ps yesterday: "I have no knowledge of secret
negotiations." He said Britain had an obligation to consult the Federal Government.
But the final decision remained with the British Government. Mr. James Callaghan,
Labour's Colonial spokesman, said Sir Roy had no right to delay progress in the talks
by refusing to sit round the conference table.
