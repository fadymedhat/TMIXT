The Rubery, Owen scheme is now in its fourth year, and opportunity has been taken
to revise the course in the light of experience. Topics for the six weekly meetings
of one-and-a-half hours (each held half in company time, half in the man's time) are
now as follows: 1. Personal adjustment 2. Health 3. Work and leisure 4. Living
arrangements 5. Financial planning 6. Final discussion
