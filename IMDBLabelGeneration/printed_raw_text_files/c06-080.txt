The performance of our talented feathered friend is not the only good thing (al-
though the one original touch) in the film, which is better-than-average glossy com-
edy, Hollywood-styled, European set. Most of it has been shot in and around the sun-
terrace of the Hotel Splendido (renamed the Dolce Vista for the picture) in Portofino
- and if there's a better view to be had from a more comfortable vantage point any-
where, I'd like to see it.
