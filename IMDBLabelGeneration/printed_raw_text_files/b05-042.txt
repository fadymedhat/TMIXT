What happens is that the unskilled worker is processed, by high-speed listening to
recorded instructions on how to do the job coupled with explanatory TV pictures,
into becoming a highly skilled, obedient craftsman in no time at all. Not only can
the raw human mind be technically equipped very quickly to do one set of skilled
manufacturing processes in one trade but, by being given another of the new audio-
TV training techniques, he can be switched to a different industry if he just gives in
and listens and looks.
