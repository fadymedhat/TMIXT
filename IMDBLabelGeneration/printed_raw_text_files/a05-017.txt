The Minister regards the recent trend of recruiting figures as encouraging. He is
confident the aim can be achieved. While the possibility of an eventual return to
National Service in some form cannot be entirely discounted, he does not agree that
the point has been reached where this need even be considered. If National Service is
ever resorted to, engagement would probably have to be for three years.
