This last objection might have had some weight in ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural
History, 13.11-12, the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making. As Pliny
was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii
in A.D. 79, his information is contemporaneous with the New Testament. The other
form of book was the codex. In this the sheets were bound together down one edge
much as they are in modern books.
