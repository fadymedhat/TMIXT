Herring fishermen call this "the outset". It is strongest at spring tides, when without
wind you will "set" out - or drift to the eastward, the length of half a fleet of nets
- almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's Knoll. Without an explanation of how
it works, it may well be that this outset, akin to the mouth of a great salmon river,
has been the biggest factor through the ages in the constancy of this great herring
fishery.
