The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the Lansdowne Road district,
but I needed more help in the church for the full rota of services on Sundays and
weekdays. Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in 1913 soon
after I had come, and he organized the Mission district and got to know, and be
known by, many of the people of the parish.
