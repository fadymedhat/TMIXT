In China, for instance, dried rats are esteemed a delicacy. The visitor is told that
they restore the hair of the bald and that a stewed black rat will ward off a fever. A
number of newly-born white mice served alive, dipped in treacle and swallowed like a
prairie oyster is considered a piece of resistance.
