Knowing the time of separation and the activity of the lead-210 solution, the ingrowth
of the bismuth-210 can be calculated. The absolute activity of the reference standards
can be calculated from the known activity of the lead-210 solution and the chemical
yield, but this calculation is unnecessary provided the same lead carrier solution is
used to prepare the reference standards and for the analyses.
