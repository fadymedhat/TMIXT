(In this strike, as reported in the Sheffield Guardian in March of that year, 1,000,000
men were out a fortnight, disciplined and solid, when only 20 per cent of them stood
to gain anything from the strike and the other 80 per cent made sacrifices for their
fellow men; this remarkable strike raised the question of a living wage and showed
the worth of the common man.)
