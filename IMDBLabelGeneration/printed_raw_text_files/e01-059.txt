In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris hand-crocheted blouses, gossamer fine in
texture, are sold at a very high price. With a little time and concentration the woman
at home can produce fashion articles as elegant as those of Paris - a blouse, delicate
gloves or a fine edging for collar, cuffs or a handkerchief.
