Compared with 1958, the expenditure index for 1959 showed increases of 4 to 6 per
cent for couples without children and those with one child, and much smaller changes
for couples with several children. The quantity index, which has risen only slowly
since 1956, was almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more children, but
rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult households and by 1-2 per cent for younger
childless couples and couples with one child.
