But not one of his nimble-fingered best. GERMANY'S Russ Conway is a pianist
who calls himself CRAZY OTTO. But nothing crazy about his pianistics. He pounds
merrily away at a piece called "Piccadilly" (Polydor). I find it cute. American pianist
Floyd Cramer, who played for Elvis on "It's Now or Never," looks like having a success
on his own with "On the Rebound" (RCA).
