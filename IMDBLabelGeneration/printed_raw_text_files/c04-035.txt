Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette
Scott let loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down the river. The film
starts off brightly enough but, half-way through, the plot (as well as the boat) springs
a near-disastrous leak. Familiar members of Britain's repertory team of comedy
character-actors jump through equally familiar hoops to mild laughter.
