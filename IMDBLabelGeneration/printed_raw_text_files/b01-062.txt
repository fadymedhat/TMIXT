Should the Herald publish such advertisements? This is a difficult question. It would
obviously be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with which we disagree.
When an advertisement contains statements whose factual truth is doubtful, or where
the total content would be deeply repugnant to our readers, it is right to exercise
editorial discretion. The MRA advertisement falls into neither category, though many
readers will dislike it.
