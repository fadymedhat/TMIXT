The police began a systematic search of the line - no easy task, but one in which
patience and method paid off. At a spot on the embankment between Putney and
Wandsworth they found a bloodstained pestle such as chemists use, with some hairs
sticking to it. The murder weapon, more than likely, and perhaps evidence enough
to have brought a killer to book in modern times.
