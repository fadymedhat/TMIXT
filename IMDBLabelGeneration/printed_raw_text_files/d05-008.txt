The new century opened with James 1 ascending the throne. He was quite prepared
to be tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot spoiled that. The Puritans
had high hopes, for James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland, but those hopes
were dashed. True, a new Prayer Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans derived
little comfort from it.
