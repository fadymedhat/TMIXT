The one real weakness of the Commentator's case is that, in common with all his
colleagues, he has not, until now, been able to exhibit exactly how this enlargement
was effected nor has he been able to explain the textual movements by showing that
such changes are part of a simple and coherent plan. To understand how this is
possible it is necessary to examine the text of the Gospel.
