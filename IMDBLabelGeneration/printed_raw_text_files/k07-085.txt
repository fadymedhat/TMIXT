No. I'm not your type. I'd make you miserable. I mean that. I'd very probably be
unfaithful and that'd kill you. Then I'd be unfaithful too, to teach you a lesson. It
wouldn't work. You'd do it to spite me. I would never do it for that reason. To me
it'd be immaterial whether you'd retaliate or not. You'd go crazy if that situation
arose.
