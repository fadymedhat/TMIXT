A new question asked about housing tenure, whether the accommodation occupied
by each household was held by them as owner-occupiers; occupied in connection
with employment or as part of business premises; rented from a Council (or New
Town Corporation) or a private landlord (if so, whether furnished or unfurnished); or
occupied on some other terms. The analysis of private households by size and various
characteristics of their members has become increasingly important.
