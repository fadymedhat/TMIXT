In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup should pass from Him. Jesus shows us the
way to face life. To see all the latent frightening possibilities and yet by facing them
and knowing God is with us and that, with Him, there is nothing that can finally
defeat us. More than that, that God has something important to do with our lives
and that the nearer we get to Him, the stronger we become.
