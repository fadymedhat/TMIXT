He is also a director of a couple of garages. And he finds time as well to be a lyric
writer. He writes with Tolchard Evans, composer of "Lady of Spain" and other big
hits. Tolch, as he is known in Tin Pan Alley, likes songs with a month in the title.
He wrote "My September Love," the big David Whitfield hit of 1956.
