It said that the President and Premier noted "with satisfaction" the agreement in Vi-
enna on the need for an effective Laos ceasefire, which should lead to progress toward
a Laos agreement at the Geneva conference. "Particular attention was also given to
the nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament. "The situation in
regard to Germany was reviewed, and there was full agreement on the necessity of
maintaining the rights and obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin."
