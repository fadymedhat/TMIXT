Short of wearing the same uniform, which is not contemplated, the Navy, Army and
Royal Air Force would become, for practical purposes, a single defence force. There
would be complete co-operation at all levels in training and operations. This would
apply also in the command structure and central administrative organisation. Mr.
Watkinson, Minister of Defence, has been working on the plan for some months, with
the Prime Minister's approval.
