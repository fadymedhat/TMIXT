Then they stop swimming and are caught. In the seine-net film this usually seemed
to happen just after the fish had risen above the footrope, and presumably out of its
field of disturbance, or bow wave. This suggests that the wave might be transmitted
by the sea-bed, though the footrope in this case was actually just off the bottom and
was indeed passing over some fish.
