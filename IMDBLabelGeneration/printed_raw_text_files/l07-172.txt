Like Clive, he was enthusiastic about the engine and decided, apparently on the
strength of its efficiency, that Sandpiper was fit to live in. I was more than thankful for
his help when we had installed my things and the boat began to move. The river was
crowded with flocks of sailing boats which swirled round us like gulls and there were
two locks to negotiate, but Max seemed to know exactly what to do and at the same
time kept me supplied with important bits of information that Clive had forgotten to
mention, such as keeping to starboard and giving way to sail.
