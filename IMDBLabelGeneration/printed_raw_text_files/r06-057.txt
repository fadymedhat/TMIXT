We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta. You can free-wheel down a quarter of
the way. In the middle of the journey is a valley with a sea of vines and olives and
beaches of earth pricked to blood by the hoe. Rising from the flecked sea are islands
tapering to shipwrecked castles and towns, grey, rose-headed mariners clinging like
limpets to the rock.
