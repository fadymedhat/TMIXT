The Czechoslovak kitchen, again, is so languorous, so passionate, and possibly com-
parable alone to a gypsy melody. The paprika and caraway perfume the meats with
their antithesis. The opulent varieties of Czechoslovak pastries recall in fact the rich
heritage of rich embroideries and costumes specifically national. The art and science
of cookery, however, is essentially French, and, irrespective of the fact that I have
never run across anyone in Gaul who has been a glutton, I can positively say that it
has been equally difficult to find one who has not been an epicure.
