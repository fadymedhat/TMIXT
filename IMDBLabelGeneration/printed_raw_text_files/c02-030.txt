When the final miracle does occur, it is accepted as a marvellous joke; no one has
learned anything. Wicki suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue. In complete
silence he shows the faces of people walking in the streets, smug, content, satisfied,
and thoroughly frightening. Wicki has succeeded in his second film in recording his
personal apocalypse of the last days of a sick society.
