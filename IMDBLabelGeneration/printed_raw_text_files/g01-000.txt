A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was imprisoned in England. His son, in revenge,
was harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg, and doing it to some purpose.
John Philpot, one of that new class of merchant financiers which the city of London
was now producing, fitted, equipped and manned a fleet from his own resources, and
captured the young Mercer in a brilliant Channel fight.
