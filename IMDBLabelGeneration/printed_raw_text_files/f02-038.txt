The large attendance and atmosphere of this Conference, held in October, 1957,
reflected not only an increasing awareness of the problems of men and women nearing
or already in retirement but also a strong desire on the part of all concerned for
concerted action towards preparing men and women for life in retirement and more
adequate provision of facilities for crafts, hobbies and leisure-time interests for those
who are retired.
