On the specific question of the use of Blue Streak, Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be
easier. He can point out that this is the only rocket and launcher in Europe to have
reached a sufficient stage of development for adaptation as the first stage in putting
a heavy satellite into outer space. There has also been some talk of adopting another
British rocket, Black Knight, for the second stage, but the French have one of their
own called Veronique which they would like to see used.
