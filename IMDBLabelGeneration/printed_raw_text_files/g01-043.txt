There were two other sources of public revenue - first, the Church, which wisely
followed the lead of the Commons and in its own Convocations granted equivalent
contributions, and second, the foreign merchants, with whom the King's officials had
formerly made private bargains at 'colloquies of merchants', and whose payments were
now authorized by parliamentary sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in excess of
the rate for native merchants.
