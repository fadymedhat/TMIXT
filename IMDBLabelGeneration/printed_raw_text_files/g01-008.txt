Obedient to the policy of his King, de Vienne avoided trouble at sea as cleverly as Du
Guesclin avoided it on land. Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for an elusive

to besiege the well-protected fortress of St Malo. This involved the dreary method of
mining operations in which Gaunt, under the Black Prince, had shown considerable
skill at the siege of Limoges.
