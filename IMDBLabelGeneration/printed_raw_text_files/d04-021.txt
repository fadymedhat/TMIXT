The action of the Shamir writes books and their books are readable. This Shamir
is indeed a rare diamond that incises the hardest rock, the hardest facts. And these
creatures existed from the beginning. It is "the stone, which the builders refused,
but it is to become the head-stone of the corner". (Ps. 118, 22.) And the stone shall
tell!
