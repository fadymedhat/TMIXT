There may be some who will argue that routine destroys the soul. It is so easy, they
say, to get into a rut. Save us from the school curriculum and even worse the school
system whereby for meals everybody knows beforehand exactly what, on any given
day of the week, they are going to have. If - such a critic may say - you are calling
us to adventure, do not strangle us before we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
called 'order'.
