It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling such a beautiful building with
suitable fittings; I made a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
the architect, himself a fine artist. It is quite possible to put beautiful things into a
beautiful church and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsuitable to the environs.
