Stealing from cars is about the commonest kind of crime in the book. There's nothing
that absolutely ties the missing money to the circumstances of your father's death,
that's the point. Same with the passport. It's gone and that's that. It may turn up
in a dustbin somewhere or at the back of a drawer. As far as the police are concerned
there's nothing to go on.
