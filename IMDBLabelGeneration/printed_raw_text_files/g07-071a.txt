There were few things in Augusta's whole life, full of calamities though it was, that
hurt her more than this contemptuous slight from George Anson Byron, whom she had
loved with an unswerving loyalty, and had looked on as her intimate friend. Moreover,
he was without the right to make such pronouncements: he had inherited nothing
from her brother but his title, whereas she was not only of nearer consanguinity but
the chosen recipient of his property.
