Furthermore, developments in the detail form of the fins made possible a reduction
in the total surface area required as compared with the use of smooth continuous
passages for the same thermal duty and pressure losses. The properties of compact
form, low weight, and design flexibility thus developed found ready application on a
much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage scale air separation plants.
