I AM happy to report that I saw something this week I have never before witnessed,
either in pictures or outside - a budgerigar playing a drunk scene, and playing it with
perfect timing and technique. It gives one loud, clear hiccup and falls flat on its back.
This brilliant budge, I may add, gets no credit in the cast list of Come September
(Odeon, Leicester-square), which suggests that it is either using a stand-in for the
stunt stuff or needs a more pushful personal manager.
