Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always insensitively pushing, Miss Sheila Allen his wife,
always palely appealing, Mr. James Maxwell, the editor, always comically abashed by
the events, and Mr. Aubrey Richards, the father-in-law, always comically grotesque;
they were not asked to modulate from their set moods but played with proper effi-
ciency and, in the case of Mr. Richards, with lavish and suitably gaudy colour.
