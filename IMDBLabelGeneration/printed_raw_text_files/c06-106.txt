The girl is a knock-out (see picture of Julie Newmar for confirmation). She also has
quite a mission in mind. She, "younger, prettier, stronger, and more intelligent" than
the wife (as she soon tells her), wants to have the perfect baby. And she has chosen
the husband (James Mason), who is an academic friend of her Nobel prize-winning
father to be Big Daddy.
