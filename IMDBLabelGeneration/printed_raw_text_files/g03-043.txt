One of the students was young George, and another the dark-haired little grand-
daughter of Charlie Grant. George often spoke at the Sunday school. He christened
the babies. Also, when called upon to do so, he would officiate at funerals. Religion
was one of his pet subjects, for being well acquainted with the Bible, which he had
read in prison where it was the only book they were allowed, he could debate on
religion with anyone.
