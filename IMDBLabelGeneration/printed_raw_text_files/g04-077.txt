Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers were very welcome and
the ladies organized a canteen. Life was in those years more than busy. We now had
a vicarage next to the church, and I was most fortunate in having for eight years a
most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known well in Limpsfield where she
had a house next to the church.
