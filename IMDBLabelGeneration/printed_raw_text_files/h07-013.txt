These figures are much higher than the national averages, and may be thought to
indicate a lack of balance in some of the towns. On the other hand these groups
offer fairly varied opportunities of skilled employment and are highly diversified as
regards products, markets and methods of manufacture. Consumer goods industries
such as the manufacture of food and drink, tobacco, clothing and footwear are under-
represented in the new towns generally though not in Basildon and Welwyn.
