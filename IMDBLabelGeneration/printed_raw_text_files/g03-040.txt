As they became known the Choir went to working-men's clubs, to Conisborough on
cheap trips to sing to the miners, and sang for other organisations such as the Bakers'
Union, for whom they went on Saturday evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel, to rally the
members. The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms on West Street, where a successful
Sunday school was held.
