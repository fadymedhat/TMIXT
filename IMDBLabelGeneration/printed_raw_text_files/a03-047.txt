It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson in the role of a popular orator at the
hustings, the spellbinder that Mr. Diefenbaker was in the last two campaigns. The
impression remains that the Liberal leader is still the diplomatist, more at home in the
chancery, or the corridors of the United Nations, not the father figure, so necessary in
Canadian leadership, or the practical politician, able to talk about sewage problems
in Algoma East.
