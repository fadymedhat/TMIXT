It was called "Abou Ben Adhem and the Angel." I don't know why I was so impressed
with this poem but, on reflection, it might be that I took a guilty interest in the devil-
ment business. I may well have felt that I was hell-bound under a strict Presbyterian
upbringing and a possible reprieve might come through the sugary sentiments of
"Abou Ben Adhem."
