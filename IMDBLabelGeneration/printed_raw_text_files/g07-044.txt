It was no more pleasant for the Hon. Augusta Leigh to share this kind of story with
the world than it would be for most 20th-century ladies moving in court circles and
having children to be settled advantageously in life. She had lived down the rumours
which had made the year of the Byron separation a nightmare to her, and she had also
succeeded, though with an increasing sense of effort, in persuading her little world to
avert its eyes from her husband, 'that drone', as Byron called him, whose career of
devotion to the turf was reputed to have a certain shadiness.
