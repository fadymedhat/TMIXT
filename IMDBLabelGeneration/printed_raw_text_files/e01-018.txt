We read, with sympathy, an advertisement in the reign of Charles 2 stating: 'Lost:
a lawn 1handkercher with a broad hem laced round with fine Point lace about four
fingers broad' and among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an unpaid bill for 'scarlet
satin shoes with silver lace'. The records of these tender trifles are very touching but
then lace does place upon everything a delicate sentiment.
