"The mine-workings lie north of the town," said Dan. "If we head west we ought to
cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north." So we swung west, making slow going
over rough country, sliding on shale, climbing down into draws, circling a big mesa
by a four or five mile valley, sandy-floored. It got hotter as the day wore on and we
rested gratefully by a small creek where we watered the horses and drank enough to
cure our thirst.
