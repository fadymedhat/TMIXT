Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of ventricular contraction. During cutting
or puncture of the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion of blood from the wound.
Arterial diastole is thus synchronous with cardiac systole but, when movement of
blood through arteries is hindered by compression, infarction or interception, the
more distal arteries pulsate less because their pulse is nothing other than the impulse
of the blood entering them.
