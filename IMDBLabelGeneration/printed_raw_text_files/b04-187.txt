THE Palace cinema at Buckley, near Chester, will be reopened next week by Barry
Flanagan and Eric Platt, both aged 19. Eric says: "We believe in the cinema. And
we know what people want." The combination of enthusiasm and shrewd anticipation
of public taste has launched many great enterprises. Barry and Eric have enthusiasm.
They are backed by a resurgent film industry.
