It was a little complicated to work, of course, and there had to be a big notice in the
entrance saying which day of the timetable it was - but it added immensely to the
interest and kept everybody on their toes. To have order does not mean getting into
a dull routine. I have great sympathy with the young wife who does not always want
to do the washing on a Monday.
