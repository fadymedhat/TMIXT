Medical evidence established that Mary Money had been dead for about an hour
before her body was discovered, and this matched reasonably well with the timetable
of the train in question. More important evidence came from a signalman at Purley
Oaks, who had seen, as the train passed his box, a couple struggling in a first-class
compartment; but he seemed to have been used to seeing couples engaged in close
embraces, for he had not attached any importance to the scene at the time.
