AFTER ten days of intermittent, near fatal ennui, the eleventh Berlin International
Film Festival was suddenly jolted back to life by two extraordinary films, Bern-
hard Wicki's "Das Wunder des Malachias" ("The Miracle of Father Malachias") and
Michaelangelo Antonioni's "La Notte." The number of German film directors who
have made first rate works in the last 25 years can be counted on the fingers of one hand: Frank Wysbar ("Fa"hrmann Maria"), Helmut Ka"utner ("Die Grosse Frei-
heit No. 7"), Herbert Selpin ("Titanic"), Wolfgang Staudte ("Rotation"), and Georg
Klaren ("Wozzeck").
